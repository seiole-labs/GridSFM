## Scope and disclaimer

This is an independent Seiole Labs research and engineering fork. It is not
affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Microsoft.

Results are experimental and should not be treated as operational energy-grid
guidance, safety guidance, or production guarantees.

GridSFM is an open-source framework for AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF),
the optimization that determines the cost-minimizing generator dispatch
satisfying all of a power grid's physical and operational constraints.
The framework has two parts:

- **`power_grid/`** is the data pipeline. It turns grid topologies
  into solved AC-OPF scenarios in `.pyg.json` format, and ships a Hugging Face loader for fetching pre-built
  scenarios.
- **`model/`** loads the released GridSFM neural surrogate and runs fast
  AC-OPF inference on those `.pyg.json` scenarios. 

Model checkpoints and pre-built power-grid datasets are hosted on
Hugging Face: [microsoft/gridsfm](https://huggingface.co/collections/microsoft/gridsfm).

## `model/` — Neural surrogate models

> **Tested OS:** Ubuntu 22.04 / 24.04.

### Typical workflow

1. **[Install](model/README.md#install)** — `cd model && python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -e .`
2. **[Get the checkpoint](model/README.md#get-the-checkpoint)** — `load_from_hf("microsoft/GridSFM_Open")` or download once with `hf download`.
3. **[Run inference](model/README.md#quickstart)** — single-graph via `predict(model, scenario)`, or batched via `model(batch)`. Examples for shipped samples (`examples/infer_samples.py`) and the [OPFData](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07234) dataset (`examples/opfdata.py`).

See [model/README.md](model/README.md) for install, checkpoint download, output schema, the column conventions in `gridsfm/schema.py`, and cache customization for large N-1 sweeps.

## `power_grid/` — Grid data and processing pipeline

> **Tested OS:** Ubuntu 24.04 and macOS 26.4.1.

### Typical workflow

1. **[Download the dataset](#gridsfmhf_util--huggingface-dataset-loader)** — use the HuggingFace loader bundled with the `gridsfm` package to fetch the power grid models and OPF results to a local directory.
2. **[Inspect the data](#power_gridusviewer--data-viewer)** — launch the browser-based viewer to explore network topology and OPF results.
3. **[Run the topology solver pipeline](#power_gridustopology_solver_pipeline--raw-topology--solved-scenarios)** — process raw topologies into solved AC-OPF scenarios for model training.

### `gridsfm.hf_util` — HuggingFace dataset loader

A Python utility (`gridsfm_pg_loader.py`) for downloading and loading
GridSFM US power grid models and OPF results from HuggingFace Hub. Shipped
as part of the main `gridsfm` package — no separate `hf_util` install
needed; install `gridsfm` itself per [model/README.md#install](model/README.md#install).

```python
from gridsfm.hf_util import GridSFM_PG_Loader

loader = GridSFM_PG_Loader("microsoft/GridSFM_US_power_grid",
                            export_dir="./gridsfm_data")
model  = loader.load_model("texas", hour="16h")
```

See [model/gridsfm/hf_util/](model/gridsfm/hf_util/) for the loader source.

### `power_grid/US/viewer/` — Data viewer

A lightweight browser-based viewer for inspecting grid data. Requires a
data directory with `16h/` and `04h/` subfolders (e.g. the output of
`GridSFM_PG_Loader.download_all()`).

```bash
cd power_grid/US/viewer
python serve.py --data-dir /path/to/gridsfm_data
```

See the [viewer README](power_grid/US/viewer/README.md) for details.

### `power_grid/US/topology_solver_pipeline/` — Raw topology → solved scenarios

A self-contained Julia pipeline that turns raw grid topologies into
AC-OPF-solved `.pyg.json` scenario files ready for model training and
evaluation. The pipeline has two main stages:

1. **Topology solver** — takes a raw topology JSON and iteratively relaxes
   parameters until strict AC-OPF converges, producing a `.solvable.json`.
2. **Scenario generator** — applies controlled perturbations (load scaling,
   cost shuffling, generator outages, line derating, voltage squeezing) to
   the solvable base grid and solves each variant, emitting one `.pyg.json`
   per scenario.

See the [topology_solver_pipeline README](power_grid/US/topology_solver_pipeline/README.md) for setup and high-level usage, and [PIPELINE_DETAILS.md](power_grid/US/topology_solver_pipeline/PIPELINE_DETAILS.md) for in-depth file and stage documentation.
